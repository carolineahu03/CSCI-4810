Simple Maze Game in Unity

The goal of this game is to collect all the coins throughout the maze in as little time as possible. It will consist of 4 levels, where each level's difficulty increases throughout the game. To reveal the door, the player must first collect all the coins, this will then allow the player to move on to the next level. 

The core of this project deals with a couple topics that were discussed in class. The topic I emphasised on most were shaders. I incorporated many of the shaders that were introduced for project 4, and learned how to create my own toon and glow shader in C#. Extending these shaders into Unity took a great amount of time. This was my first time using Unity so it required a lot of research. I was also able to implement object behaviors. Throughout the maze there are these big bouncy balls that will try to prevent the player from getting to the coins. Overall I'm pretty proud of this project and learned so much through Unity. I hope you enjoy!

Milestones:
  - Incorporate shaders from project 4
    - toon, glow, metallic, mesh, texture
  - Object movements/behaviors
    - rolling and bouncing balls
    - speed of player movements
    - use of rigid body and colliders
  - Levels with increasing difficulty
    - obstacles such as balls, blocks, torus
  - Gamifications
    - levels, scoreboard and timer that keeps track of coins
  - Design
    - it's creative, fun, and feasible
